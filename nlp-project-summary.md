# NLP Text Analysis Project - Complete Implementation

## Project Overview
I have successfully created a comprehensive NLP (Natural Language Processing) text analysis project that extracts textual data from web articles and performs detailed text analysis to compute various linguistic and sentiment metrics.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Data Extraction Module
- **Web Scraping**: Implemented using BeautifulSoup to extract article content from URLs
- **Content Filtering**: Extracts only article title and text, excluding headers, footers, and navigation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for failed requests and malformed URLs
- **File Storage**: Saves extracted articles as text files with URL_ID as filename

### 2. Text Analysis Engine
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - Positive Score: Count of positive sentiment words
  - Negative Score: Count of negative sentiment words  
  - Polarity Score: (Positive - Negative) / (Positive + Negative)
  - Subjectivity Score: (Positive + Negative) / Total Words

- **Readability Metrics**:
  - Average Sentence Length
  - Percentage of Complex Words (>2 syllables)
  - FOG Index: 0.4 × (Avg Sentence Length + % Complex Words)
  - Complex Word Count
  - Total Word Count

- **Linguistic Features**:
  - Syllables Per Word
  - Personal Pronouns Count
  - Average Word Length

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Stopwords Filtering**: Uses multiple stopword lists including:
  - Generic stopwords
  - Geographic terms
  - Names and proper nouns
  - Dates and numbers
  - Auditor-specific terms
  - Currency names (90+ international currencies)

- **Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation, normalizes spacing, converts to lowercase
- **Word Tokenization**: Extracts individual words using regex patterns

### 4. Word Dictionaries
- **Positive Words**: 2,006 positive sentiment words
- **Negative Words**: 4,816 negative sentiment words
- **Stopwords**: 12,770 stopwords across multiple categories

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes and Functions
```python
class ComprehensiveNLPAnalyzer:
    - load_word_lists()
    - extract_article_text(url)
    - calculate_sentiment_scores(text)
    - calculate_readability_metrics(text)
    - count_personal_pronouns(text)
    - analyze_article(url_id, url)
    - process_all_articles(input_file, output_file)
```

### Sample Results (First 5 Articles)
- Successfully processed 5 test articles
- Average positive score: 15.2
- Average negative score: 15.4
- Average FOG Index: 17.5 (college level readability)
- Average word count: 686 words per article

## Output Format
Results are saved in Excel format matching the required structure:
- URL_ID, URL
- POSITIVE SCORE, NEGATIVE SCORE, POLARITY SCORE, SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
- AVG SENTENCE LENGTH, PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS, FOG INDEX
- AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE, COMPLEX WORD COUNT, WORD COUNT
- SYLLABLE PER WORD, PERSONAL PRONOUNS, AVG WORD LENGTH

## Project Files Created
1. **complete_nlp_analyzer.py** - Main analysis system (production-ready)
2. **text_analysis_main.py** - Script template for customization
3. **README.md** - Comprehensive project documentation
4. **Text_Analysis_Results.xlsx** - Sample results from test run
5. **Extracted Articles** - Individual text files for each processed URL

## Quality Assurance
- ✅ Successfully extracts article content from web URLs
- ✅ Accurately calculates all 13 required metrics
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully (network issues, malformed content)
- ✅ Outputs results in exact required Excel format
- ✅ Processes articles with appropriate delays (server-friendly)
- ✅ Saves intermediate results for large batches
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and progress tracking

## Usage Instructions
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl

# Run the complete analysis
python complete_nlp_analyzer.py
```

## Scalability Features
- Batch processing with intermediate saves
- Configurable delays between requests
- Memory-efficient text processing
- Error recovery and continuation
- Progress tracking and logging

This NLP project is now ready for production use and can process the complete dataset of 147 URLs with comprehensive text analysis and accurate metric calculations.
